# Data Entry Analysis
## Issues of the Datasets
* There are missing data from the datasets. In file 1, we can tell that there are some missing data fields that might have an influence on the data analysis.
* The structures of the datasets are inconsistent. The attributes on File 1 are Date, z, Tem, density and Colony Diame Species. File 2 has attributes including Date, Depth, Cuni, Cuni ColonySize, Chippo #/L and Chippo ColonySize. File 3 has attributes including Date, Dept, Cuni #/L, Cuni ColonySize, Chippo #/L, Chippo ColonySize, Chla and Temp. The differences of structures among datasets will increase the difficulty in joining the datasets together. 
* The datasets lack explanation of attributes. Not given the explanation of attributes, the data analysts won't be able to gain a good data understanding of the datasets. Also, we have no idea what attribute z in file 1 refers to.
* Metadata cannot be found for the datasets. This will increase the difficulty to understand the data.
* Important attributes are missing. Since plankton change their distributions from day to night, it is significant to record the time when the data is collected. 
* Some attributes lack appropriate units labeling. File 1 doesn't have the unit specified for both the density and the Temp attributes.File 2 lacks unit labeling for both Depth and Chippo ColonySize. File 3 doesn't have units labeled for Depth and Cuni ColonySize.
