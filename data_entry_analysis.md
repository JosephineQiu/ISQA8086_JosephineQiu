# Data Entry Analysis
## Issues of the Datasets
* There are missing data from the datasets. In file 1, we can tell that there are some missing data fields that might have an influence on the data analysis.
* The structures of the datasets are not aligned. The attributes on File 1 are Date, z, Tem, density and Colony Diame Species. File 2 has attributes including Date, Depth, Cuni, Cuni ColonySize, Chippo #/L and Chippo ColonySize. File 3 has attributes including Date, Dept, Cuni #/L, Cuni ColonySize, Chippo #/L, Chippo ColonySize, Chla and Temp. The differences of structures among datasets will increase the difficulty in joining the datasets together.
